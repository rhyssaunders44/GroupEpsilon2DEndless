PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH
-PULLING is creating an isolated copy, it will allow us to work AT THE SAME GOD DAMN TIME
-PULLING will also stop us from killing each others copies ie. renaming things in the files then getting an error saying someone else has renamed all your variables.
-once you have made changes to your pull, push it to your branch. the changes, once they all work, will then be compiled into the main.
